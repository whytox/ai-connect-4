## Solution

The implemented algorithms are:<br>

- Monte Carlo Tree Search with Upper Confidence Bound as default policy for child node selection
- MinMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning 
  - with heuristic to avoid direct adversarial winning

*Note*: you can use `demo.py` to play against the computer.
